The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Store the following into variables:
  number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

- Output your fortune to the screen like so:
  "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var job = "The Wackness"

console.log("You will be a" + job + "in" + location + "and married to" + partnerName + "with" + numChildren + "kids.");
