- Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number),
  square that number, and return the result.
  It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

- Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number),
  divide it by 2, and return the result.
  It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".

- Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers,
  figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number,
  and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."

- Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius),
  calculate the area based on that, and return the result.
  It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
  - Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.

Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations,
  using the functions you wrote earlier:
  - Take half of the number and store the result.
  - Square the result of #1 and store that result.
  - Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
  - Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).
