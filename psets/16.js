/*
The World Translator

Write a function named helloWorld that:
- takes 1 argument, a language code (e.g. "es", "de", "en")
- returns "Hello, World" for the given language, for at least 3 languages.
  It should default to returning English.

Call that function for each of the supported languages
and log the result to make sure it works.
