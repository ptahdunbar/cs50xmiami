The Fortune Teller part 2

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Write a function named tellFortune that:
- takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
- outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
