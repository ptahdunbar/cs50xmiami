The Pluralizer

Write a function named pluralize that:
- takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number.
- returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog".

Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.
- Bonus: Make it handle a few collective nouns like "sheep" and "geese".
