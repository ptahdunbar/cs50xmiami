The Word Guesser

You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to
guess the word (like Hangman without the hangman, or
like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).


- Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the
  word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters
  (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').

- Write a function called guessLetter that will:
  - Take one argument, the guessed letter.
  - Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
  - If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters
    array to reflect that.
  - When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__')
  - and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
  - It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed,
  - and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.

- Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with
  various letters to check that your program works.

- Bonus: Make it more like Wheel of Fortune:
  - Start with a reward amount of $0
  - Every time a letter is guessed, generate a random amount and reward the user if they found a letter (multiplying the reward if multiple letters found), otherwise subtract from their reward.
  - When they guess the word, log their final reward amount.

- Bonus: Make it like Hangman:
  - Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong) and only let the user guess a letter once. If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.
  - Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0), and subtract or add to that number every time they make a wrong guess.
  - Once the number reaches 6 (a reasonable number of body parts for a hangman), inform the user that they lost and show a hangman on the log.
